test_in_connect(
  dir = "apps",
  server = "beta.rstudioconnect.com",
  account = "barret",
  apps = basename(apps_deploy(dir)),
  urls = connect_urls(dir, apps = apps, account = account, server = server),

\arguments{
\item{dir}{base folder to look for applications}

\item{server, account}{Parameters that could be supplied to \verb{[rsconnect::deployApp]}}

\item{apps}{applications within \verb{dir} to run}

\item{urls}{Named vector of urls to visit. By default this is determined using the \code{server}, \code{account}, \code{dir}, and \code{apps}}

\item{app}{app number or name to start with. If numeric, it will match the leading number in the testing application}

\item{port}{The TCP port that the application should listen on. If the
\code{port} is not specified, and the \code{shiny.port} option is set (with
\code{options(shiny.port = XX)}), then that port will be used. Otherwise,
use a random port.}

\item{host}{The IPv4 address that the application should listen on. Defaults
to the \code{shiny.host} option, if set, or \code{"127.0.0.1"} if not. See
Details.}
