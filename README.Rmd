<!-- This is an R package to install all dependencies to test the bleeding edge of all relevant packages to the Shiny team. -->

<!-- For more direct usage examples, see [`rstudio/shinycoreci-apps`](https://github.com/rstudio/shinycoreci-apps). -->


## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak", repos = sprintf("https://r-lib.github.io/p/pak/stable/%s/%s/%s", .Platform$pkgType, R.Version()$os, R.Version()$arch))
pak::pkg_install("rstudio/shinycoreci")
```

These GitHub packages will be installed to make sure the latest package development is working as expected:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
pkgs <- shinycoreci:::shinyverse_remotes

# remove branches, sha, and commas
github_pkgs <- sub("[, (@#].*$", "", pkgs)

# print as links to repos
cat(
  paste0(
    "* [", pkgs, "](http://github.com/", github_pkgs, ")",
    collapse = "\n"
  )
)
```


## FAQ:

If you run into an odd `{pak}` installation issue:

* Run `pak::cache_clean()` to clear the cache and try your original command again
